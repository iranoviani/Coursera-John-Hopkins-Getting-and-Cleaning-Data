Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assessment
========================================================
The package consists of two datasets, named as "dataset1.txt" and "dataset2.txt" which are attached on the peer assessment part as two separate files. These datasets were obtained using the "run_analysis.R" code on the Github (https://github.com/iranoviani/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data).

The R file contains all the steps prior to merging the datasets as per required by the course.

The explanation about the content and the structure of the data can be found on "Codebook.md" which is also on Github repo.
